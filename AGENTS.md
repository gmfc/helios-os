# Codex Guidelines

* Use `pnpm` for all Node tasks:
  * `pnpm i` to install dependencies.
  * `pnpm dev` to start development.
  * `pnpm test` to run tests.
* Run `pnpm test` before committing. If tests fail due to environment issues, note it in the PR.
* The project uses TypeScript strict mode; do not disable it.
* Use 4-space indentation and ensure every file ends with a trailing newline.
* Keep commit messages descriptive and the working tree clean.
